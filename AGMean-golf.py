Program to calculate the arithmetic-geometric mean, inspired by this Stack Exchange challenge:

The Arithmeticâ€“Geometric Mean of two numbers is defined as the number that repeatedly taking the arithmetic and geometric means converges to. 

The golfed version, which incorporates feedback from user mathmandan, is:
f=lambda a,b,n:f((a+b)/2,(a*b)**.5,n-1)if n else(a,b)

def AGMean(a,b,n):
	for count in range(0,n):
		a,b = (a+b)/2, (a+b)**.5 # Sets a to the arithmetic mean and b to the geometric mean
	return a,b
